# Numpy-
A details guide about using Numpy for data science projects.

## NumPy is a Python library.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and can be used freely.
NumPy is used for working with arrays.
NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".
# Array
Array data structure is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables).
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.

# Installation of NumPy

If you have PYTHON and PIP already installed on a system, then installation of NumPy is very easy.

Install it using this command:


C:\Users\Your Name>pip install numpy

Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword:

import numpy

# Important NumPy Functions for Data Science
So, here are all the important functions of NumPy for data science that you need to know:

## min and max: 

 used to find the minimum and maximum value of a NumPy array
## mean: 
 used to find the mean value of the NumPy array
## std:
 used to find the standard deviation of the NumPy array
## median:
 used to find the median of a NumPy array
## percentile:
 used to find the percentile in a NumPy array
## linspace:
  used to get evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval
## shape:
 used to get the shape of an array 
## reshape:
used to reshape an array
## copyto:
 copies the values of one array to another array
## transpose: 
 used to reverse the axes of an array 
## stack: 
 used to join the sequence of an array along a new axis
## vstack:
 used to join the sequence of an array along a new axis vertically
## hstack:
 used to join the sequence of an array along a new axis horizontally
## sort: 
used to get a sorted array
